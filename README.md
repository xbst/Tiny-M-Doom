### This build is still WIP. All files are released to help you build a similar machine or draw inspiration from. I don't promise that everything will work. Build at your own risk. Also, be careful with high chamber temps. I'm not responsible if something bad happens.

## Progress:
- Built the frame.
- Tested the printed parts. (Used ABS for testing, final parts will be CF-PPA.)
- Some STL and DXF changes. (Some parts on the CAD model weren't perfectly aligned.)
- Electronics, wiring done. Time to test.
## Future Plans:
- Test the printer, fix parts, rinse & repeat.
- Seal the filament drawer so the potentialy hygroscopic filament doesn't absorb mositure. (Will require new panels.)
- Fix the air hole on the rear gantry belt path to insulate better.
- Larger door with better visibility. (Also needed for the sealed filament drawer.)
- Top mounted Chamber Heater + Air Filter unit.
- Lighting
- Webcam mount behind double PC. (Chamber temps won't be safe for the webcam.)
